# imaginext
This is a Next.js visualization tool that helps developers understand the structure of their Next.js app by displaying its file and folder hierarchy. The tool uses d3.js to create a tree-like structure that represents the app's file and folder organization, making it easy to navigate and understand the app's architecture.

## Features
Display the folder structure of a Next.js app in a tree-like format
Show the file names and their extensions
Ability to expand and collapse folders to view their contents
Easy navigation through the folder structure using mouse click events

## Usage
To use the visualization tool, simply clone this repository to your local machine and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm i imaginext
npx imaginext
```

This will start a local development server and you can access the visualization tool by visiting [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) in your browser. The tool will then extract the file and folder structure of your app and display it in the visualization.


## Limitations
The tool is currently limited to displaying the file and folder structure of Next.js apps. Future updates may include the ability to display the structure of other types of web applications.
